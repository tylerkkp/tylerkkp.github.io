<p>2020 has been an eventful year, to say the least. My wife became a real-estate agent a bit over two years ago, and her career is starting to take off. We are very cautious financially, which has given us the incredible opportunity to educate ourselves and make career transitions intentionally and thoughtfully. Prior to real-estate, she owned a pub, but our sonâ€™s arrival made the hours of a pub-owner less than ideal. After a couple of years as a mom, she got her real-estate license and is now a rather busy agent! I feel fortunate to have been home for much of the year due to Coronavirus - I have gotten to experience many of the milestones in my sonâ€™s life which many working parents have missed, in the past. There is definitely a silver lining to all of the yearâ€™s pain and difficulty.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d been working in mechanical engineering for almost 5 years when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. In March or April, my team began working remotely - my first time doing so. After a small adjustment period of getting my desk setup optimized and ironing out video-chat issues, it was glorious. Iâ€™ve found remote work to be ideal for my introverted personality. While in the office, getting interrupted at my desk would often mean a 5-10 minute return to â€˜flowâ€™. The asynchronous communication required in a remote work environment fits my communication style well. I like to make sure my words properly convey the meaning I intend.</p>

<p>At the end of August 2020, I was laid-off for the first time in my life. I fully acknowledge my incredible priviledge in being able to say it was a relief. Iâ€™d been slowly moving in the direction of a career in programming far before I was laid off. The financial buffer provided by a frugal lifestyle and my wifeâ€™s burgeoning career has now allowed me the time to work on building my skills and portfolio for a transition into the new field of software. If you are reading this and are in need of a python developer / data analyst, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
