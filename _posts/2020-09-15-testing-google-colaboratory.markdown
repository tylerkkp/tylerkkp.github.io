I have been shopping around for a new laptop lately, and my specific list of 'wants' has been pointing me toward a few chromebooks. I'm going to be using this computer for programming and data analysis work, so I wanted to make sure that a chromebook will be up to the task. 

### Google Colaboratory

There are a bunch of cloud development platforms out there, but I wanted to try the Google offering first since it is sure to work well on a system running ChromeOS. I have to say I'm impressed. Jupyter notebooks in the cloud with easy Google Drive access - it just works. 

### Github Gist

Conveniently, Github allows rendering of Jupyter notebooks in Gists, so I uploaded a copy of the notebook to Github, and will embed it below. If you are interested in viewing the notebook on Github, it can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/tylerkkp/380a27431894e464adfa22b0ede8dbe2)

Here is the final graph from the above notebook:

### Conclusion

All in all, I'm very happy with how this little experiment turned out. I'm not sure I'd go with a bottom spec chromebook, but would be fairly comfortable getting a higher-spec chromebook like a Pixelbook. I will keep shopping and certainly provide an update if (when) I end up with a new machine :)
